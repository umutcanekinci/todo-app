## Features

### Implemented Features:
- **Task Management**:  
  Users can add tasks to a list with a title and optional description.
- **Status Management**:  
  Each task has three statuses:  
  - Open  
  - In Progress  
  - Done  
  Open tasks cannot be directly moved to "In Progress".
- **Data Persistence**:  
  - All tasks are saved to a local database file (`database.db`) for persistence.  
  - Upon reopening the app, tasks are restored.
- **Themes**:  
  A dark and light mode can be toggled (currently in progress).
- **Due Date**:  
  Tasks can be assigned a due date. Overdue tasks will eventually be highlighted in red (not yet implemented).

## Bugs & Known Issues

### Fixed Bugs:
- **Minimize Button**:  
  The minimize button was initially too small but has been fixed.
- **Exit Button**:  
  The exit button's appearance has been corrected.
- **Logo and Info Button**:  
  Adjusted to appear white as per the theme.
- **Last Element Deletion Freeze**:  
  Deleting the last task caused a freeze, which is now resolved.
- **Unlimited Tasks**:  
  Added a limit to prevent infinite tasks from being added.

### Open Issues:
- **Scrollbar**:  
  There is no scrollbar for the task list, causing usability issues with many tasks.
- **Alt+Tab Icon**:  
  The app icon does not appear in the taskbar when Alt+Tab is used.  
  [Related Question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60442386/check-if-window-is-in-background-tkinter)
- **TopLevel Window Behavior**:  
  Sometimes, `TopLevel` windows (for details or editing) do not open correctly.
- **Status Filter**:  
  The ability to filter tasks by status (e.g., only show "Done" tasks) is not implemented yet.
- **Overdue Marking**:  
  Highlighting overdue tasks in red is a planned feature.
